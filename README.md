The ipython notebook Processing.ipynb uses CountVectorizer from sklearn package to create a bag of words. The features of the classifier are vectors of whether a particular word from bag of words is present in the movie review and length of that particular movie review. The labels are negative sentiment (0) and positive sentiment (1). By adding more and different words to bag of words, the accuracy of classification increased to maximum of 70%. ModelTraining.ipynb contains training of model. This task was part of a kaggle competetion on sentiment analysis on the given dataset. I learnt about CountVectorizer from discussion forums of the competition
